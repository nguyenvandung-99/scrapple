Scrapple, inspired by Scrabble

You can find the game at: https://nguyenvandung-99.github.io/scrapple/

Rules:

- You begin with 7 letters taken from the tile bag, each with different score value.
- The goal is to make an English word as long as possible with the letters given.
- The score will be the sum of letter values and a magical bonus based on the word length.
- The word submitted from the previous round will be used again for this round.
- You can use up to half the letters of the previous round.
- The letter from the previous round will only grant bonus point and not the letter value.
- You will lose if you score below 300 points for 3 consecutive rounds.
- You will win if you use up the tile bag.
- Each shuffle counts as one round with no score gained.
Have fun!
